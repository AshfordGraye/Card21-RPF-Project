# Object Oriented Cards

*A school project for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, to create a programming project that can be completed offline.*

**Team Name - Birds Are Not Real**
 
* **Team Lead** - Luke Henzell
* **Team QA**   - Luke Campbell
* **Lead Dev**  - Ashford Rennie


> **This project springboards from a pre-existing RPF project that teaches users how to create a deck of cards using Object Oriented Programming.**
>
> **We will teach users how to apply values onto the cards within that deck, and how to influence the cards within the deck - first by shuffling the deck, then by dealing the cards into a player hand.**

- *The 'Step By Step' folder includes step by step instructions with examples of where the student should be at the start and the end of each step.*

- *The 'Final Project Presentation' folder includes a copy of the original Raspberry Pi Foundation Project in its completed form, a completed form of our project, and a .pdf guide of all included steps. An included sample code area is at the bottom to demonstrate functionality taught in the project.*
