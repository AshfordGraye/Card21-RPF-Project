A project teaching how to use a previously created deck of cards in an Object Oriented Programming based game.

This project will specifcally teach the user how to create a game of Card 21 using Object Oriented Programming. 

It will include a completed version of a previously posted Raspberry Pi Foundation project as it's base to simulate the idea that user has already done the project.

From there, the user will be guided through through steps required to convert the project into one suitable to use as a base for mathematics in card games.

The user will then be guided through the steps required to create a game of Card 21 - explaining the concepts and procdures involved. 

The guide itself will be available as a PDF with steps and screenshots to guide the user.
