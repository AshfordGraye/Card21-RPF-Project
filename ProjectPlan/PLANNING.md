RUN THROUGH FEW EXAMPLE IDEAS FOR GAME LOGIC TO BUILD ON 

CREATED COIN AND DICE 

    - DECK OF CARDS PROJECT ON RPF SITE - PERFECT BASE.

PROJECT HAS BEEN STARTED BY CREATING TWO DECK FILES - ONE IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE RASPBERRY PI FOUNDATION'S OWN PROJECT, THE OTHER HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO ALLOW FOR MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS. WE WILL TEACH THE USER HOW TO MODIFY THE CODE FOR MATHEMATICS - THEY CANT MAKE A CARD GAME WORK WITHOUT IT.

-- NOTE -- 
    THE ACE IN A DECK AS STANDARD COUNTS AS ONE - IT ONLY COUNTS AS SOMETHING ELSE DEPENDENT UPON THE GAME AND SO HAS NOT BEEN CODED TO COUNT AS ANYTHING ELSE YET.

Steps for teaching:
    start with the EXACT code on Rasppberry Pi Foundation site - chances are that a user will have done that first. 
1) how to edit the code to give the cards integer values
2) how to shuffle the deck 
    FIND SHUFFLE ALGORITHM
3) Move the cards into the hand 
    
4) create a second hand to deal to
    NEED SEPARATE FUNCTION FOR OTHER HAND 




    FINAL PRODUCT PLANNING

    NEED TO CREATE FUNCTION TO RUN FOR PRESENTATION.

    PRINT MESSAGE <- STEP 1 - ADDING VALUES TO THE DECK. 

                            DEMONSTRATE BY SPECIFYING CARD AND GIVING IT A VALUE

                            TWO EXAMPLES

    THEN DO SAME FOR
