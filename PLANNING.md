PROJECT HAS BEEN STARTED BY CREATING TWO DECK FILES - ONE IS A REPRESENTATION OF THE RASPBERRY PI FOUNDATION'S OWN PROJECT, THE OTHER HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO ALLOW FOR MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS. WE WILL TEACH THE USER HOW TO MODIFY THE CODE FOR MATHEMATICS - THEY CANT MAKE A CARD GAME WORK WITHOUT IT.

-- NOTE -- 
    THE ACE IN A DECK AS STANDARD COUNTS AS ONE - IT ONLY COUNTS AS SOMETHING ELSE DEPENDENT UPON THE GAME AND SO HAS NOT BEEN CODED TO COUNT AS ANYTHING ELSE YET. AS THE VALUE OF ELEVEN WITHIN CARD 21 IS BASED UPON THE HELD HAND, IT MUST BE LEFT UTUIL THEN AS WE WILL BE TEACHING THE USER HOW TO DO IT OURSELVES.

Steps for teaching:
    start with the EXACT code on Rasppberry Pi Foundation site - chances are that a user will have done that first. 
1) how to edit the code to give the cards integer values
2) how that can produce the same results as before but with MORE functionality
    COMPARE CARDS.DECK.ORIGINAL TO CARDS.DECK.VALUED
3) shuffle a deck
4) deal a deck  
    4.5) figure out how to make card 21 in python
5) how to make card 21 - will split further into steps as steps become understood.
